DB SECURITY:
============
		1. Authentication
		2. Authorization

1. Authentication:
==================
	- to check / verify user credentials(username & password)
before login / connect to db server.
	- these credentials are created by DBA only.

syntax:
=======
create user <username> identified by <password>;

Ex:
create user u1 identified by u1;

2.Authorization:
================
	- to perform some operations over database.
	- giving by DBA only.
	- by using "DCL" commands.

DCL:
====
		i) grant 
		ii) revoke

i) grant:
=========
	- granting permissions to user.

syntax:
=======
grant <privilege name> to <username>;


ii) revoke:
===========
	- to cancel permissions of user.
syntax:
=======
revoke <privilege name> from <username>;

Privileges:
===========
	- privilege is nothing but permission.
	- these privileges are two types.
				1) system privileges
				2) object privileges

1) system privileges:
=====================
	- these privileges are giving by DBA only.
Ex: connect,create table,unlimited tablespace,
create view,create synonym,create sequence,create index,
create materialized view,..................etc.

syntax:
=======
grant <system privilege name> to <username>;

Ex:
sql> conn system/tiger
sql> create user u1 identified by u1;
sql> grant connect,create table,unlimited tablespace
     to u1;

sql> conn u1/u1
sql> create table test1(sno int,name varchar2(10));
sql> insert into test1 values(1,'smith');
sql> update test1 set sno=1021 where sno=1;
sql> delete from test1 where sno=1021;

HOW TO CANCEL A PERMISSION OF USER:
===================================
sql> conn system/tiger
sql> revoke connect from u1;

SQL> CONN
Enter user-name: U1/U1
ERROR.

2) object privileges:
=====================
	- these permissions are giving by DBA (or) USER
to perform some operations over a table/db object.

Ex: select,insert,update,delete / "all" keyword.

syntax:
=======
grant <object privilege name> on 
<table name / db object name> 
to <username>;

case-1: DBA to USER:
====================
EX:
sql> conn system/tiger
sql> create user u2 identified by u2;
sql> grant connect to u2;

sql> conn u2/u2
sql> select * from dept;
error.
sql> select * from system.dept;
error.

SQL> INSERT INTO SYSTEM.DEPT VALUES(50,'DBA','HYD');
error.

SQL> UPDATE SYSTEM.DEPT SET LOC='PUNE' WHERE DEPTNO=50;
error.

SQL> DELETE FROM SYSTEM.DEPT WHERE DEPTNO=10;
error

Granting object privileges to user u2:
======================================
sql> conn system /tiger
sql> grant select,insert,update,delete on dept to u2;
						(or)
sql> grant all on dept to u2;

sql> select * from system.dept;---allowed
SQL> INSERT INTO SYSTEM.DEPT VALUES(50,'DBA','HYD')--allowed
SQL> UPDATE SYSTEM.DEPT SET LOC='PUNE' WHERE DEPTNO=50--allowed
SQL> DELETE FROM SYSTEM.DEPT WHERE DEPTNO=10;---allowed

Cancel object privileges of user u2:
=====================================
sql> conn system /tiger
sql> revoke select,insert,update,delete on dept from u2;
						(or)
sql> revoke all on dept from u2;

sql> select * from system.dept;
error.

case-2: User to User:
=====================
	- if a user want to give permission to another user then 
the first user should get permission from DBA with 
"with grant option" statement then only a user can give 
permission to another user otherwise not possible.

EX:
sql> conn system/tiger
sql> create user u22 identified by u22;
sql> create user u33 identified by u33;

sql> grant connect to u22;
sql> grant connect to u33;

sql> grant select on dept to u22 with grant option;
sql> conn u22/u22
sql> select * from system.dept;----allowed

sql> grant select on system.dept to u33;
Grant succeeded.

SQL> CONN
Enter user-name: U33/U33
Connected.
SQL> SELECT * FROM SYSTEM.DEPT;---allowed

ROLE:
=====
	- a role is nothing but to assign same privileges to 
group of users who are working on same project.
	- these roles are created by DBA only.

ex:
						X-PROJECT
                      |
					MOD1	MOD2			MOD3
					 |		 |		 		|
					 3E	5E				3E
				(A,B,C) (P,Q,R,S,T)	(X,Y,Z)
					|
					R1
					|
			CONNECT privilege

	- to create a role we need to follow the following 3 steps
those are,

step1: create a role:
=====================
syntax:
=======
create role <role name>;

step2: assigning privileges to a role:
======================================
syntax:
=======
grant <privilege name> to <role name>;

step3: assigning role to users:
===============================
syntax:
=======
grant <role name> to <users>;

EX:
SQL> CREATE ROLE R1;
Role created.

SQL> GRANT CONNECT TO R1;
Grant succeeded.

SQL> GRANT R1 TO A,B,C;
Grant succeeded.

SQL> CONN
Enter user-name: A/A
Connected.

SQL> CONN
Enter user-name: B/B
Connected.


SQL> CONN
Enter user-name: C/C
Connected.



SQL:
====
	> DDL
	> DML					BY DEVELOPER
	> DRL / DQL
	> TCL
	===========================
	> DCL					BY DBA ONLY
